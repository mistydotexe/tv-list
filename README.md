# tv-list

This is just an IPTV M3U list that curated from mainly publicly available IPTV sources found across the internet, but further curated personally for use on the TV at my home.<br>
This list contains mainly channels in English and Chinese (and/or Chinese-related languages), and mainly Malaysian channels.<br>
**Please check commit details for any updates on the list (as well sources moving forward, this is as of April 2025).**

# List link: [Copy here!](https://github.com/mistydotexe/tv-list/raw/refs/heads/main/plist.m3u)
Right click and use `Copy link address`; or for mobile, long tap and tap `Copy link address` on the link above.
~~This makes my setup work easier too so yeah XD~~

# Important note

This will be unmaintained for quite some time while it is working. I have no guarantees I will fix any issues as this is more a "For **personal** use" list, so by using/forking anything from this repo, you hereby acknowledge that you know things in here will break at any time and **you** will check back the original sources should something in here breaks.<br>
I will eventually fix it if it breaks, but that depends on me, **not you**, so you better off checking back the original lists if you don't like how I do my things.
